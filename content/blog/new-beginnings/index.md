Here I am, and ready to blogging again after years. And this is my first blog post in my new blog page. I'll talk about my future plans in this post.

### Who am I?

I’m a software engineer who live in İstanbul, Turkey. I’m working for Countly Analytics as a full-stack engineer since 3 years. My primary expertise is web development on client and server-side. I’ll mostly write about JS, MongoDB, Node and Linux in this blog.

Except my profession I'm a indie filmmaker. Even if I didn't shot anything because of pandemic situations since last year. 

And a gamer who love play video-games if I can find a time after all works. It's not too easy to manage time for me in these days. I have a full-time job that requires full-focus in weekdays. And at weekends I'm trying to build a start-up company.

### Why I decided to blogging again after years?

There is a saying in Turkish that meaning "The words flies, the text remains." 
I'm taking notes for things that I think need to remember when I need it next time in my daily routine to my notebook, to my iPad and sometimes notes app in my Mac. Yesterday, I noticed I can write that notes as posts on my blog. So with that way, it would be better for both of me and developer community. But there was a problem. I didn't have a blog.

Actually I had a personal blog in past. I was wrote too many blog post about the things that I learned in my university years. But somehow I succeed to lost all of that blog data. (I know it’s not a good promotion for a software developer. But that’s the truth. :D) So as result, you’re reading this post on my new blog that hosted on Gatbsy cloud now. Thanks to Gatbsy for allowing me to create my personal blog seamlessly. 
### Result

I'll try to write more posts in this blog regularly. It may be a movie critic, sometimes a review for a product that I bought and sometimes a software project or tool. I hope I can make these plans real.

Thanks for reading my first blog post until the end.
