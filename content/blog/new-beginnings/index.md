Here I am, and ready to blogging again after years. And this is my first blog post on my new blog page. I'll talk about my plans in this post.

### Who am I?

I'm a software engineer who lives in Ä°stanbul, Turkey. I'm working for Countly Analytics as a full-stack engineer for three years. My primary expertise is web development on the client and server-side. I'll mostly write about JS, MongoDB, Node, and Linux in this blog.

Except for my profession, I'm an indie filmmaker, even if I didn't shot anything because of pandemic situations since last year. 

And a gamer who loves to play video games if I can find a time after all works. It's not too easy to manage time for me these days. I have a full-time job that requires an entire focus on weekdays. And at weekends I'm trying to build a start-up company.

### Why did I decide to blog again after years?

There is a saying in Turkish that meaning "The words flies, the text remains." 
I'm taking notes for things that I may need to remember when I need it next time in my daily routine. Yesterday, I noticed I could write that notes as posts on my blog. So in that way, it would be better for both the developer community and me. But there was a problem. I didn't have a blog.

I had a personal blog in the past. I was writing too many blog posts about the things that I learned in my university years. But somehow, I succeed to lost all of that blog data. (I know it's not a good promotion for a software developer. But that's the truth. :D) As a result, you're reading this post on my new blog hosted on Gatbsy cloud now. Thanks to Gatbsy for allowing me to create my blog seamlessly. 

### Result

I'll try to write more posts on this blog regularly. It may be a movie critic, sometimes a review for a product that I bought, and sometimes a software project or tool. I hope I can make these plans real.

Thanks for reading my first blog post until the end.
